## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### 1. Frontend (Client)
- **3D Engine:** Three.js (Optimized for 60+ FPS across devices).
- **UI Framework:** HTML5/CSS3 with Vanilla JS (Premium glassmorphic aesthetic).
- **Physics:** Cannon-es / lightweight custom AABB collision to ensure smooth, high-framerate performance on low-end devices.
- **Asset Pipeline:** 
  - Using strictly **Real 3D Models** (GLTF/GLB formats).
  - High-quality models for weapons, characters, and maps sourced from reliable CDNs.

### 2. Backend (Server)
- **Framework:** Node.js with Express.
- **Networking:** Socket.io for low-latency, real-time multiplayer synchronization.
- **Server Authority:** The server validates movement and hit detection to prevent cheating, utilizing client-side prediction for lag-free gameplay.

## ⚡ Performance & Optimization Strategy

To guarantee a steady **60 FPS** and cross-device compatibility:
1. **Asset Optimization:** Compressed textures, LOD (Level of Detail) models.
2. **Rendering:** Frustum culling, InstancedMeshes for repeated objects (bullets, environmental props).
3. **Tick Rate:** Server runs at a steady 20-30 ticks per second; the client interpolates positions to render smoothly at 60+ FPS.

## 🛣️ Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Engine Foundation & Multiplayer Setup *(CURRENT)*
- [x] Set up Node.js server with Socket.io.
- [x] Establish the client-server connection.
- [x] Synchronize basic player positions and states across the network.

### Phase 2: High-Quality Asset Integration
- [ ] Load a real `.glb` character model.
- [ ] Load real `.glb` weapon models.
- [ ] Set up a visually stunning map (cyberpunk/neon arena style).
- [ ] Implement First-Person camera logic attached to the 3D model.

### Phase 3: Core Gameplay Mechanics
- [ ] **Advanced Movement:** Sprinting, sliding, jumping, and crouch mechanics.
- [ ] **Shooting Logic:** Raycasting from the camera center, server-validated hit detection.
- [ ] Recoil, bullet spread, and weapon firing animations.

### Phase 4: UI Integration & Game Loop
- [ ] Connect the massive HTML/CSS UI to the game engine.
- [ ] Implement Health/Damage systems, Kill Feed, and Scoreboard.
- [ ] Create game modes (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch).
